# Java Full Stack Project

Technologies Used - Java, SpringBoot, ReactJs, HTML5, TailwindCSS.


This repository appears to be a full-stack employee management system project. It is designed to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee information and likely provides a user interface for interacting with an employee database.

Key Components of the Repository
Frontend (employee-project-view/):

Tech Stack:
Built with React (using Vite for a fast development experience).
Styled with Tailwind CSS.
Features:
AddEmployee.jsx: A form or modal to add new employee details.
EmployeeList.jsx: Displays a list of employees, possibly with options to edit or delete records.
UpdateEmployee.jsx: A form to update existing employee information.
Navbar.jsx: A navigation bar for accessing different parts of the app.
EmployeeService.jsx: Handles API requests (to the backend) for employee-related operations.
Backend (src/):

Tech Stack:
Backend built with Java and Spring Boot.
Follows a layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository).
Database operations are managed using Spring Data JPA.
Features:
EmplyController.java: Exposes RESTful APIs for employee-related operations.
EmployeeEntity.java: Represents the database schema for the Employee table.
EmployeeService/ServiceImpl.java: Implements business logic for handling employee data.
EmployeeRepository.java: Interface for database queries.
Resources:
application.properties: Configuration for database connections and other properties.
Common Tools:

Maven: Used for managing backend dependencies and builds (pom.xml).
Vite & NPM: Used for managing frontend dependencies and builds.
Purpose of the Repository
This project likely serves as an Employee Management System where:

Frontend: Allows users to interact with the application via a web-based UI.
Backend: Manages business logic and handles data persistence in a database.
Use Cases:
Add new employees.
View a list of employees.
Edit/update employee details.
